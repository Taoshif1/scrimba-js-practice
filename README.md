Welcome to my **Scrimba JavaScript Practice Repo** — a collection of exercises, small projects and problem-solving files completed during my **JavaScript revision journey** using [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

- ✅ This is my **second-time revision** of JavaScript — the first one was in my repo: [LearningJS](https://github.com/Taoshif1/LearningJS).  
- ✅ This repo focuses on **polishing**, **practicing** and **maintaining international coding standards**.

## 📚 Platform: [Scrimba - Learn JavaScript for Free](https://scrimba.com)

- Scrimba is a free interactive coding platform where I practiced hands-on challenges while following their structured JavaScript course, there is a paid version too.  
- I completed every challenge, rewrote cleaner code and maintained a neat repo structure — as a **quality-driven developer**.

## 🔁 Upcoming Plan: **3rd Revision (Advanced Topics)**

The learning never stops. I’m planning to **revisit JavaScript for the 3rd time** —  
but this time with **advanced concepts** in mind:

- `async/await`, `Promises`
- `Fetch API` and `HTTP Requests`
- `Closures`, `Hoisting`, `Scopes`
- And many more real-world patterns...
